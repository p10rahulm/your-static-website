# (i) The form on this static site is enabled through formspree
#  1.   Setup: Set email ID and secondary_email below the first time you use the contact form
#       you will get a mail asking you to confirm email ID
#
#  2.   Pricing: Free for first 50 emails a month. At some point if this becomes a pain,
#       I'll implement the form layout with some other endpoint
#
#  3.   The layout used is contact.html in layouts/_default folder
#
# Since this template is static, the contact form uses www.formspree.io as a
# middleware proxy. The form makes a POST request to their servers to send the actual email
#
# (ii) Next Steps
#
#  1.   Set your email address under 'email' below
#  2.   Upload the generated site to your server
#  3.   Send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
#  4.   Click the confirm link in the email from www.formspree.io
#  5.   You're done. Happy mailing!
